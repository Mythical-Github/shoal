To Do:
    user needs to login atleast once
    , but do they need to launch a game each once, 
    or does it look for a file, 
    and does the game dir in their being set matter as well

    use new online pluto mode
    lan mode toggle option for atleast plutonium
    non plutonium lan mode, needs a way to gen the token that gets passed to the launcher


Later:
    test offline


Maybes:
    linux support, modern debian and ubuntu atleast
    username and arg passing for aurora clients
    remove global args section doesn't really make much sense anymore
    add game specific launch args (two total config sections, game specific launch args like /max, and game client args like sv cheats)
    Automatically set font size to 8
