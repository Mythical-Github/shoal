To Do:
    progress screen(for things like downloading, unzipping, cionfiguring, cleanuip, etc...)
        deal with hitch on selecting/downloading nazi zombies portable, alterware, plutonium, t7x, mw2
        takes in a list of tuples
            each tuple
                action text
                function to exec
        takes in a final function to call when everything finishes


    update the readme


Later:
    alterware mw2 more setup needed
    have pluto download locally options
    aurora client games
    test offline
    linux support, modern debian and ubuntu atleast


Maybes:
    config edit for all game args, also pass when possible through game launch for when configs don't already exist
    remove global args section doesn't really make much sense anymore
    add game specific launch args (two total config sections, game specific launch args like /max, and game client args like sv cheats)
    Automatically set font size to 8
    non plutonium lan mode, needs a way to gen the token that gets passed to the launcher    
    dir scan option to find and populate game directories
